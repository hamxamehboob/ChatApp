# System Architecture:
* The User will download the app and install in the mobile.
* User will see a splash screen where the user will tap the GET STARTED button to go to login Page.
* User will see a login page where user will need to enter their email address and password to sign in. The app will authenticate user credentials using Firebase Authentication, and if they are valid, it will take user to the home screen.      
* If user doesn't have an account,the signup button will redirect user to Signup page where user can create his/her account.Once user have created an account or logged in, user will be directed to the Home screen. Where user will be able to see their chats with other users and start new conversations by tapping on the "New Chat" button.
* User can chat with anyone present in the contact list and can start conversation by tap on their name to enter the Messaging screen. Here, user can send and receive messages with that user.    
* Once user done chatting, user can return to the Home screen by tapping the "Back" button on the top left corner of the screen.
